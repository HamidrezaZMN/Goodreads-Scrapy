# Goodreads-Scrapy
Goodreads.com is website for bookworms<br>
I have used scrapy library to scrape the data i want, from goodreads pages<br>
The result is text files with the wanted datas (in this particular project I didn't store them into a database because there was no need to)<br>

# Two-Methods-That-Are-Used
In this repositroy I have uploaded two folders<br>
One of them is the complicated one, and the other one is easy to use<br>
Look for README.md file for each one, for more info
